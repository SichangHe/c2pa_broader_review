## Deepfake

Accessible, scalable and performant

### Disinformation

- Influence democratic process [@strickland2024election;
    @collomosse2024authenticity; @rainey2023trait]
- Mislead public perception and belief through
    social media [@kharvi2024understanding; @collomosse2024authenticity;
    @rainey2023trait]
- Erode trust in media, democracy, authority, artwork, archival and
    legal evidence; "truth decay" [@strickland2024election; @bushey2023ai;
    @shoker2023confidence; @romero5031627deepfake]

**Countermeasures**

- C2PA to attest content is real [@strickland2024election;
    @collomosse2024authenticity; @balan2023ekila]
    - 👍 Source and history [@kharvi2024understanding; @bushey2023ai;
        @shoker2023confidence; @mo2023towards]
        - Traceability and trust for not being tempered [@fotos2023ensuring]
    - 👎 Can be spoofed by taking photo with photo [@vilesov2024solutions]
    - 👎 Privacy: disclose sensitive information, but
        mechanisms exist [@fotos2023ensuring]
    - 👎 Can be stripped, is usually stripped [@collomosse2024authenticity]
    - 👎 Need wide adoption [@collomosse2024authenticity; @balan2023ekila]
    - 👎 Provenance does not imply trust [@mo2023towards]

---

- Preserve content on searchable blockchain [@kharvi2024understanding;
    @romero5031627deepfake; @bureacua2024blockchain; @balan2023ekila;
    @rainey2023trait]
    - 👎 complex to implement; need wide adoption
- Watermarking by content creator [@kharvi2024understanding]
    - 👍 detect tempering, protect copyright
- JPEG Trust: "trust report" for user to evaluate trust [@mo2023towards]
    - 👍 Directly address trust
    - 👎 Implementation details unclear; privacy

**Countermeasures**

- Cloud provider limit bad actor [@kharvi2024understanding]

## Generation not for faking

- Bias in generation [@bushey2023ai; @mo2023towards]
- Intellectual property laundry [@bushey2023ai; @collomosse2024authenticity;
    @balan2023ekila]
- Not transparent or explainable, thus problem for regulation [@bushey2023ai]
- Privacy and consent of training data [@bushey2023ai;
    @collomosse2024authenticity; @balan2023ekila]

---

**Countermeasures**

- Explainable AI (XAI) [@bushey2023ai; @romero5031627deepfake]
- Bias mitigation and de-identification of training data [@bushey2023ai]
- NFT of generation with authenticity metadata, ORA (Ownership, Rights,
    Attribution) [@collomosse2024authenticity; @balan2023ekila]
- Visual matching for generation [@balan2023ekila]

## General countermeasures

    @vilesov2024solutions]
- Detection
    - Human technique [@bushey2023ai]
    - ML detection model, e.g., GAN
        - 👍 Much more accurate than human [@bushey2023ai]
        - 👍 Can be improved constantly [@vilesov2024solutions]
        - 👎 Cannot outcompete generator [@kharvi2024understanding;
            @romero5031627deepfake]
    - Physiological signal analysis for video, e.g.,
        blood flow [@romero5031627deepfake]
    - Multi-modal detection [@romero5031627deepfake]

- Detection (cont.)
    - Watermarking training data [@bushey2023ai; @collomosse2024authenticity]
    - Watermarking generated content [@shoker2023confidence;
        @romero5031627deepfake]
        - 👎 Can be stripped, tempered or faked [@shoker2023confidence;
            @collomosse2024authenticity]
- Fingerprinting: search by perceived hash [@collomosse2024authenticity;
    @balan2023ekila]
    - 👍 Recover stripped metadata; some resilience to
        tempering [@collomosse2024authenticity]
    - 👎 Sensitive to editing [@collomosse2024authenticity]
